# Adapter-Moving-Square

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to use the Adapter Design pattern.

The base class "Figure" and the Adaptee/Implementer class "LegacyRectangle" are inherited by the Adapter class "SquareAdapter".

This will allow the SquareAdapter class to utilize the inherited classes functionality and resize it to the desired size.
